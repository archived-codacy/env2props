This is a tool to transform your environment variables into the java Properties format intended to be passed from the command line.

e.g.:

```
$ env
LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8
LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

$ env2props
-DLC.PAPER="en_US.UTF-8" -DLC.MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8" -DLANG="en_US.UTF-8"
```

Under the option `-p` or `--prefix` you can pass a matching prefix for the environment variables.

e.g.:

```
$ env
LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8
LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

$ env2props -p LC_
-DPAPER="en_US.UTF-8" -DMONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
```

The output is provided on standard output and without any additional new-line, as it is intended to be used in-line within java command execution.

## Conventions

Each environment variable is transformed as follows:

 - remove the trailing prefix (if specified)
 - trasform all the `_` characters into `.`

## Usage

After making the binary executable and available on the `PATH`(should work out-of-the-box on any linux machine).
You can use this tool in-line while launching java applications e.g.:

```
sh -c "java $(env2props) -jar <application>.jar"
```

## Rationale

According to the [Twelve-factor App](https://12factor.net/config) the configuration should be passed to the applications via environment variables.

The "de-facto" standard for configuration in Scala application is [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) and env variables are a [supported fallback](https://github.com/lightbend/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides); still it is not possible to override *virtually* any configuration of our application if not properly encoded the binding accordingly.

Although [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config#overview) offers a first class integration with Java system properties:

> users can override the config with Java system properties

This makes it easy to bridge the gap and by having a standard way to convert environment variables into Java system properties make it possible to fully comply with [Twelve-factor App](https://12factor.net/config).

## Compile

You need to have the crystal compiler available in your classpath to succesfully build this utility, otherwise you can compile it statically using a docker image using `make buildStatic`.
